# Determining_Bleedthrough_CrossExcitation  
  
## by Karina Guadalupe  
  
This repository is used to determine the bleedthrough and cross excitation of the FRET pair mTurquoise2 and mNeonGreen. Epifluorescent widefield microscopes from the Sukenik Lab at UC Merced were used for the sample data provided. 

To generate the figures, clone the repository and run the scripts from within the directory on your computer. 

Directory files are as follows:

./images - raw microscopy images

"image_analysis.ijm" - imageJ script used to analyze the raw microscopy images 

"BT_CX_plots.py" - python script used to calculate and plot the bleedthrough and cross excitation
